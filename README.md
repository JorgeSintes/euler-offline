Project Euler Problems Offline
====

Use when you want to solve Project Euler problems when not connected to the internet.

Includes questions and answers (hashed).

For a user-friendly way of working through Project Euler problems, checkout @dmadisetti's project: https://github.com/dmadisetti/rules_euler

## Repo Usage
Write the `p{i}.py` file, corresponding to problem `i` so it outputs the solution to stdout (use `print()`). Then, run:
```bash
./solve.sh p{i}
```
in order to see the hashed solution to problem `i`.
